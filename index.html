        <h2>Why Should I Improve My Iron Play?</h2>
        <p>Golfers who are able to hit their irons flush know they can shoot really good scores without needing to always bombing it off the tee. Thatâ€™s where you need to be. When you can get solid contact with your irons, the frequency you hit greens increases and even when you do miss the green, you will be pin high more often than not, and being pin high is proven statistically to equate to better scores.</p>
